# HELLO-WORLD

Writing an "HELLO WORLD" message on an android application.

The purpose of the project is to creating a simple library using native language and integrating that library on a Android mobile application.
This way the library that was written in C++ language got elevated to JAVA language level and became usable for the Android mobile application.
This was done by using JNI and NDK that was provided by Android Studio.
